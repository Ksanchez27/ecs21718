                <h3>Five Achievments of Martion Luther King Jr.</h3>
                <ol>
                   <li><strong>He led the Montgomery Bus Boycott</strong>
                            On December 1, 1955 an African American woman named Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat for a white person and was arrested due to the racial segregation laws. 
                            This led to the Montgomery Bus Boycott which was planned by E.D. Nixon and led by Martin Luther King. The boycott lasted for 385 days. 
                            During this time King was arrested, his home was bombed and he was subjected to personal abuse and threats. 
                            The protest ended on December 20, 1956 with the US Supreme Court ruling that segregation on public buses was unconstitutional.
                            </li>
                            <br> 
                   <li><strong>King was the first President of SCLC</strong>
                            Inspired by the bus boycott, King, along with other civil rights activists, founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) in 1957 to coordinate their efforts. 
                            King was the president of SCLC till his assassination in 1968. 
                            The SCLC had a large role in the American Civil Rights Movement.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                   <li><strong>He led the Birmingham Campaign</strong>
                            Till the 1960s Birmingham was one of the most racially divided cities in US. Black citizen's faced discrimination both legally and culturally. 
                            In early 1963 King started a movement against this which is known as the Birmingham Campaign. When the campaign ran low on adult volunteers, it recruited young students and even children. 
                            The campaign gained nationwide attention when the Birmingham Police Department, led by Eugene "Bull" Connor, used high-pressure water jets and police attack dogs on the children.
                            The movement ended with Connor losing his job and the municipal government changing the cityâ€™s discriminatory laws.
                            </li>
                            <br>
                   <li><strong>He was instrumental in organizing The Great March on Washington</strong>
                            King represented SCLC and was one of the leaders of the 'Big Six' civil rights organizations who organized the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. 
                            The march took place in Washington, D.C. on August 28, 1963. It was a resounding success with over 250,000 participants, making it was one of the largest political rallies for human rights in US history. 
                            It motivated other marches and laid the stepping stone to the passage of Civil Rights Act (1964).
                            </li>
                            <br>
                   <li><strong>His speech intensified the Civil Rights Movement</strong>
                            During the March on Washington, Martin Luther King delivered the famous 'I Have a Dream' speech from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial to a gathering of over 250,000 people. 
                            In the speech's most famous passage, King departed from written text at Mahalia Jackson's cry: "Tell them about the dream, Martin!" The speech is considered the defining moment of the American Civil Rights Movement. 
                            It was ranked the top American speech in a 1999 poll of scholars.
